This is a mod allowing to connect a minecraft server to IRC. Currently it's only a servermod and as such doesn't run on clients (doesn't trigger crashes though)

It has 2 modes.

'serverbot' - it works like ForgeIRC. We almost have feature parity.
'server' - it behaves like a server multiplexing ingame users over a single connection.

There is another mode planned.

The license is basically MMPL with a twist. All derived code has to be under the same license,


A great thanks goes to buildcraft devs for creating MMPL and their ant build.xml.
